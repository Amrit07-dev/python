## live chat system 

-->First a home page has a little info about site and has login and signup firsthome page provides some snippets of what you might get in the chat app

-->After the that redirects to login page, user has to create an id with signing up with email and name and tagline.


     say i want to build a chat system, where each user has its own unique identity with a decent type of security
     -at first there is a login page redirecting to login form and signup for new users and there is also an admin
      panel created for the creator with the most priviledges which is basically hidden from users and created for 
      sole purpose of mangaging and controling the system.
     -users should have the priviledge to create their own network inside that chat system that only them and others 
      who have permission or credentials can access the network to create the network for their chat system they need
      to have permission from admin and only after admin accepts their request they can start the process of creating 
      their network in their system.
